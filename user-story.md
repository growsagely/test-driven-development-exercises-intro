Title: Implement a Simple Stack Data Structure

**As a** software developer,
**I want** to create a simple stack data structure,
**So that** I can efficiently manage items in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The stack should allow adding elements to the top (push).
2. The stack should allow removing elements from the top (pop).
3. The stack should provide a way to view the top element without removing it (peek).
4. The stack should keep track of the number of elements it contains (size).
5. The stack should handle edge cases, such as attempting to pop or peek when the stack is empty, without causing errors.
6. The stack's performance for push, pop, and peek operations should be efficient, ideally O(1) time complexity.

**Notes:**
- The implementation should be generic, allowing it to store any data type.
